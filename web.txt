                            databases, and server scripting languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js. Their role
                            involves handling data, security, and server management.

                            Full-Stack Developer: Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end
                            technologies. They can work on the entire web development process, from designing user
                            interfaces to managing server databases.

                            App Developer:

                            Mobile App Developer: Mobile app developers create applications for mobile devices like
                            smartphones and tablets. They typically specialize in one of the major mobile platforms,
                            such as iOS (using Swift or Objective-C) or Android (using Java or Kotlin). Mobile app
                            development can include both native app development and cross-platform app development using
                            frameworks like React Native or Flutter.

                            Desktop App Developer: Desktop app developers build applications that run on desktop

                            on multiple platforms with a single codebase. This is often done using frameworks like React
                            Native, Flutter, or Xamarin, which allow developers to write code in a single language and
                            deploy it to different platforms.
